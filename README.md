<h1>Dad Joke API</h1>

A flask application giving you a new, random dad joke every time you visit it. I've also built an API to go with it, so that you can implement dad jokes anywhere you want to. 

To access the API, just send a request to https://dadjokeapi.herokuapp.com/api/joke
The API sends back a random joke in json format.
